**Tokyo Olympic Data - Azure Pipeline Project**

**Overview**

This Azure Pipeline project focuses on the seamless flow of data, encompassing the ingestion, transformation, and loading processes (ETL pipeline). Leveraging Azure services such as Azure Storage, Azure Databricks, and Azure Synapse Analytics, this end-to-end solution ensures efficient handling of data from its raw form to a refined state.

**Project Components**

**1. Data Ingestion** (Azure Storage):

Objective: Ingest raw data into Azure Storage containers.

Implementation: Utilized Azure Storage to create containers and ingest data, ensuring a secure and scalable storage solution.

**2. Data Transformation** (Azure Databricks):
   
Objective: Transform raw data into a structured and usable format.

Implementation: Employed Azure Databricks to orchestrate data transformation processes, leveraging the power of Apache Spark for efficient large-scale data processing.

**3. Data Loading** (Azure Synapse Analytics):
   
Objective: Load transformed data into a scalable analytics platform.

Implementation: Leveraged Azure Synapse Analytics (formerly SQL Data Warehouse) for efficient loading of transformed data, providing a platform for analytical querying and reporting.
